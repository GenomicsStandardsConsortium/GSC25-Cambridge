<h2> GSC25 Cambridge, UK.</h2>

<p>The 20th anniversary of the Genomic Standards Consortium will be celebrated at the GSC25 meeting. It will be located where it all began, Cambridge UK. The GSC25 meeting will focus on multi-decade transformative impact and expansion of Genomic Data Standards and Microbial Genome Sequencing, looking ahead at the utilization and transparency of Artificial Intelligence and the growth of new standards in the fields of ancient DNA, eDNA, biopreservation/biodiversity, microbiomes, viromes, along with environmental and human health. 
The GSC25 will follow a three-day format with sessions on the GSCâ€™s 20-year impact on data standardization and reuse; perspectives from three decades of microbial sequencing; GSC-community partnerships; evolution of standards in the context of a network of projects and resources; evolving MIxS standards.</p>
