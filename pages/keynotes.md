Ewan Birney is the Deputy Director General of EMBL. He is also Director of EMBL-EBI, and runs a small research group.
Ewan completed his PhD at the Wellcome Sanger Institute with Richard Durbin. In 2000, he became Head of Nucleotide data at EMBL-EBI and in 2012 he took on the role of Associate Director at the institute. He became Director of EMBL-EBI in 2015. In 2020, Ewan became the Deputy Director General of EMBL. In this role, he assists the EMBL Director General in relation to engagement with EMBL Member States and external representation. 
Ewan led the analysis of the Human Genome gene set, mouse and chicken genomes and the ENCODE project, focusing on non-coding elements of the human genome. Ewan’s main areas of research include functional genomics, DNA algorithms, statistical methods to analyse genomic information (in particular information associated with individual differences in humans and Medaka fish) and use of images for chromatin structure.

## Lara Urban

Lara is Principal Investigator at the Helmholtz AI Institute and the Technical University of Munich and member of the German governmental One Health council; from 2025 onwards she will contribute to building the new One Health Institute as professor at the University of Zurich. 
Lara's research focuses on real-time genomic technology and data analysis to better understand One Health, i.e. health at the intersection of the health of organisms and ecosystems. Previously, Lara did her PhD in Cambridge, at the University of Cambridge and as predoctoral fellow at EMBL-EBI, then moved as independent research fellow to New Zealand to work closely with the national Department of Conservation, and then returned to Europe in 2022 to receive the award as German Young Scientist of the Year and start her own research group.

# Dawn Field Awardee 

The ‘Dawn Field Award for Outstanding Contributions to Genomic Standards’ annual award, established in 2022, is to recognize achievements of early-career researchers for their significant contributions to the field of genomic standards. The award honors Dr. Dawn Field (1969-2020) the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) founder and a pioneer in the field of genomic standards. Nominations are made by GSC Board members. Awardees will present their research at the annual GSC meeting. Dr. Dawn Field established the GSC consortium in 2005, building a community of researchers committed to building and implementing genomic metadata standards to make data discoverable and reusable. 

## Presenting the 2025 winner

Yet to be decided - if you have nominations please contact a GSC board member.
