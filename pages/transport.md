# International travel to Cambridge

International visitors will likely fly into one of the London airports Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted. If you have a choice, then Stansted is by far the closest, but generally only serves European flights. There are various public transport links from all airports.

Please note as of April 2025 most international visitors to the UK will require either a Visa or an electronic travel authorisation (ETA). Please check your requirements before booking your travel:
 * ETA information is [available here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-electronic-travel-authorisation-eta)
 * Check if you need a [UK Visa here](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa)


The main coach service for airport to cambridge travel is [National Express](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en)
All rail tickets can be purchased online at [TrainLine](https://www.thetrainline.com/). Note that rail tickets are considerably cheaper if booked at least two weeks in advance, most services are bookable upto 6 months in advance.

Both coach and rail take approximately the same length of time from all 3 airports to Cambridge, but the trains tend to be more frequent.
